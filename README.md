## Installation

1. Clone this repo to your computer
2. Make sure you have SBT (simple build tool) installed on your computer
3. Run 'sbt' in the main directory to start SBT
4. Inside SBT, run 'run' to list multiplicative functions with recursion

Please tell us if this doesn't work, because that means something is wrong with our instructions.
